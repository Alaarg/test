<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



There are many bolg websits available on GitHub, however,we  didn't find one that really suit coders needs so we created this enhanced one. we want to create blog website so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creative not on trabbelshoting
* You need more time to built you project and some time needing help
* You shouldn't lose yout time :smile:

Of course, there are a lot of blog websites but this one is easer and helpfull for coding debugging. So we'll be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or send to us your suggestions.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
